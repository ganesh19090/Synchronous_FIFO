# Synchronous FIFO (Verilog)

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Synchronous FIFO (First In First Out)** memory buffer in Verilog.  
The design supports configurable depth and width, and includes status signals for **full**, **empty**, **overflow**, **underflow** and **concurrent** conditions.  

A testbench is provided to verify the functionality using simulation.
